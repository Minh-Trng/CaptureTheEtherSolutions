# CaptureTheEtherSolutions
Repository to solve some of the CTE challenges in python with Web3.py

Lots of duplicate code, could have been managed better by using [Brownie](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie).

Many of the solutions are based on Christoph Michels [solutions](https://github.com/MrToph).
